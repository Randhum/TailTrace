 * Curated targets for "device with a microphone in your space" detection.

 * Scope is intentionally narrow — well-known smart-home OEMs whose devices stay
 * in fixed locations and continuously listen, plus body-worn smart glasses
 * (Meta Ray-Ban, Snap Spectacles) that record the space around them. Apple
 * manufacturer id 0x004C is deliberately excluded because every iPhone, AirPod,
 * and Apple Watch advertises it; a coffee shop full of phones must not light up
 * the alarm.
 *
 * Detection vectors collected from public OUI registries (Wireshark/IEEE)
