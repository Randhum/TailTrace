/**
 * Watches overhead air traffic for surveillance aircraft.
 *
 * Two independent signals, because either alone misses real cases:
 *
 *  1. **Registry match** — the contact's ICAO address is in [LeAircraft].
 *     Authoritative when it fires, but the bundled list only covers aircraft
 *     whose registered owner names them: measured 2026-09-17, a 250 nm sweep of
 *     Washington DC returned 394 aircraft and matched none of 2,760 community
 *     police/government hexes, while 15 helicopters were aloft.
 *
 *  2. **Loiter/orbit behaviour** — surveillance aircraft circle; airliners,
 *     and medevac flights heading somewhere, do not. An aircraft that stays
 *     inside [LOITER_RADIUS_M] of its own track centroid across several
 *     minutes, low and slow, is behaving like a surveillance asset whatever
 *     the registry says. This is what catches the unlisted ones.
 *
 * A registry hit is reported wherever it is; an unregistered aircraft is only
 * reported when it is both loitering *and* close, so ordinary traffic passing
 * overhead never raises an alert.
